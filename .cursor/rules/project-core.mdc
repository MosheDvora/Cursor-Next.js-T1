# Project Core Guidelines

## Hebrew & RTL Support
1.  **Directionality**: Ensure all container components support `dir="rtl"` or inherit it properly.
2.  **Text Handling**: When manipulating strings involving Hebrew Niqqud (vowels), be careful not to split diacritics from their letters. Use libraries or helper functions (like `lib/niqqud.ts`) designed for this.
3.  **Localization**: Hardcoded Hebrew text is allowed for now, but ensure proper spacing and typography.

## Supabase & Database
1.  **Type Safety**: Always generate types from the database schema and use them. Avoid `any` when dealing with DB rows.
2.  **Server Actions**: Prefer using Server Actions for data mutations (INSERT/UPDATE) over Client-side requests.
3.  **Client**: For reading data in Client Components, use the typed Supabase browser client.
