# Vercel & Next.js Deployment Standards

You must ensure all generated code is production-ready and safe for Vercel deployment.

## Enforcement Rules (Write code this way)

1.  **Type Safety**: Never use `any` types explicitly unless absolutely necessary. Ensure interfaces match data structures.
2.  **Linter Compliance**: Do not introduce unused variables or imports that would fail `npm run lint`.
3.  **Build Integrity**: Before finalizing a solution involving configuration changes, verify it doesn't break the build process.

## Validation Commands

When verifying code or if uncertain, assume these must pass:

```bash
npm run lint       # Check for code style issues
npm run typecheck  # Check for TypeScript errors
npm run build      # Verify production build
# or run all:
npm run check:vercel
